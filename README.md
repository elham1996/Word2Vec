# Word2Vec
Search-Engine
Information may be extracted using a search engine.
Based on the keyword sought, we suggested a system that retrieves results with titles of academic conference papers and other valuable information.
We attempted to integrate a few fundamental functions in this project, such as indexing and searching, 
as well as some additional features like as highlighting and spellchecking.
This project also includes capabilities such as PageRanking and doc2vec.
In order to improve the search engine even further, classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine and
also clustering algorithm like K- Means have been implemented.Finally, feature selection techniques 
like term-frequency vectorizer and chi squared from scikit has been applied. 
The implementation has been done on four datasets that included conference papers from multiple resources.
The mentioned features are implemented using Python libraries.

To train the project:

	1- Create folder could Data and add all doc.txt file.
         
	2- Use pip install -r req.txt file to install all python libraries.
        
To use saved model:

	1- Use pip install -r req.txt file to install all python libraries.
        
	2- Use the pretrain model and add the world you search for it.
